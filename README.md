The kidneys can be damaged by disease or injury, sometimes permanently. Kidney failure can be treated by a kidney transplant or by dialysis. A dialysis machine works like a natural kidney. A patientâ€™s blood flows into the machine and between partially permeable membranes surrounded by dialysate (dialysis fluid), which contains the same concentration of useful substances as blood. Harmful waste products, such as urea, diffuse out of the blood into the dialysis fluid. Glucose and other useful substances do not diffuse out of the blood as they are at the same concentration in the fluid.
